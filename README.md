# SuperSimpleMVVMDemo
Demo for DTU (Technical University of Denmark) course 02350.

The Super Simple MVVM Demo shows how to create a very simple UML Editor (without giving to much away, or being to complicated).

Once you understand this demo, move on to the MVVM Demo (https://github.com/BoSoeborgPetersen/MVVMDemo).
